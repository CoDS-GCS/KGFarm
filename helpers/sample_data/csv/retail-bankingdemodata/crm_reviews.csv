2016-06-02,5,"usten Butler brought the humanity and connection to what can be a very stiff, lifeless, and scary transaction. Not only that, it is quite possibly the largest purchase my wife and I will ever make. We didn't simply want to transact with a faceless institution. A lot was riding on picking the right house and making sure everything would work out. Austen was there for us, every step of the way. It's true. Austen got us the best deal. Yes, that's also true. But it's more than that. From when we first starting looking to over a year later when we found the home we wanted, his presence, positivity, and guidance gave us the confidence to take the step and move into our dream home. It's made a HUGE difference for our family, we're right where we want to be, have 13 kids on our block, and couldn't be happier - and it's all thanks to Austen Butler's help.",Eagle National Mortgage,8,2022-07-23 19:40:20.795727

I had my share of challenges with the original underwriter through no fault of Chase yet he stepped in quickly to rectify any issues I had. He was the glue that kept this deal together. I did have some challenges with my first property falling through and the last minute yet Chaz kept my spirits up and assisted through quickly transitioning to the new and much better property in the end.

Every other day it was a new request. The appraiser that they hired made so many mistakes I had to send in corrections and then during the underwriting process they had to go back and make more corrections. Wyndum would continue to ask for copies of documents over and over again. There were many documents that I had to send 3 and 4 times because they ""lost"" them or was not filed correctly, we went through 4 different people through the process. I would NEVER use them.

2016-10-14,5,"Expert loan officer, well versed in VA and the financial impacts of loan component changes. The best I have worked with across 7 home buying/selling deals. Now advocated for by the #1 real estate broker in the state due to his ability to close complicated and high pressure deals. She places him at the top of the list after 32 years in the business! Professionally and patiently answers detailed questions and can rally the expanded NASB team (also stellar!) to support your needs. He handled my complicated VA loan that seemed to change every week while we tried to buy an Antebellum home (tough comps) during my retirement from the military (tough income verification) with five families all swapping homes (tons of contingencies). Everything along the way mattered and Aaron and the NASB team got it done (even on weekends) and closed on time with the best interest rate in the market and no added origination fees. Look, do NOT pass up an opportunity to work with him. ",Eagle National Bank,48,2022-07-20 08:43:40.795727

We were not satisfied with the origination cost so we applied to lending tree for competitive bids. Several lender matched or slightly beat NASB but none were convincing at closing on time. We chose NASB because of Dallas Goodlet believability on the closing. The sales, loan service and application process was competitive, assuring, professional, timely, supportive, and truthful.

2017-09-05,1,"The closing process for a VA loan went smoothly. But the loan servicing by this so-called bank is a complete disaster. I set up our loan for automatic payments using their clunky website. Unlike other banks with which I do business, the NASB website is not intuitive and does not provide confirmation for your entries. For the first 10 months, payments were automatically debited from my external account as scheduled. However, when the escrow amount changed, NASB debited the old amount from my account and sent a deficiency letter for the balance -- unlike every other bank I have used in which the amount of the debit was automatically debited. NASB sent me a ""credit counseling letter"" telling me that they did not apply any of the loan payment and would charge me a late payment over double the deficiency of $40 and change .... and suggested credit counseling services. When I called their servicing department, the representative told me the letter was sent in error and that everything had been adjusted so my account was showing that it was current. Two weeks later, I received a total of two voice mail messages and an e-mail in a span of 20 minutes from NASB's default department. The woman with whom I first spoke was rude, said she showed no record of my earlier call, it was my problem, and then hung up on me. The second agent, a man in their default department, said that he did not show that I had made any automatic payments and that NASB's system was not set up to adjust anything. After having over 25 years of mortgage payments with various banks, I have never experienced such incompetence and rude service. I specifically instructed the last agent to request that they sell servicing of our loan to another bank that is capable of actually performing customer service for a veteran ",Eagle National Bank,3,2022-07-24 11:04:36.795727

2017-12-24,1,"Our loan officer was happy to communicate before we committed. Once we committed he only communicated with us AFTER I questioned items and problems and AFTER I questioned why we weren't settling before our rate lock expired. We had no idea where we were in the process unless I contacted Steve. Poor, poor communication. Mr. Kang also was ""sure"" our house would appraise for $30k more than our house did, talking us into a loan that we didn't end up appraising for and then causing us to have to refinance at only .4% lower than our current mortgage. Our appraiser was disorganized and called twice for pictures he forgot. He used poor comps. We were contacted several times to look at documents that were expired before we could even sign on (within minutes of the email notifications). Only good was the actual settlement with a very sweet and competent notary (and thank goodness we were done). Poor process, poor communication - we will NEVER recommend NASB and I have already told two people refinancing to steer clear. ",Eagle National Bank,27,2022-07-21 06:18:37.795727

2016-05-20,1,"This loan started off quite well. Our rep, Donna, was friendly and quick to respond to questions. She clearly explained how things would unfold, and it all sounded great. What I didn't count on was that the Bank never kept a single promise she made. I had the same problem with this Bank 15 or more times. I would ask for assurance about something, Donna would respond that things would be completed as I wished, and her promise was violated by the Bank EVERY SINGLE TIME. For example, in our first or second conversation, I explained to Donna that my wife would be traveling out of the country 11 weeks after beginning the loan process. Would it be a problem to get the loan closed before that? Not at all, she said. We should close several weeks before my wife's departure. 11 weeks later, the Bank was not ready to close. How did that happen? Donna would ask us to email documentation, which we would email back within 2-12 hours, depending on the occasion. Donna would then assure us that the documentation that we sent her was great, and the Bank had everything it needed. Then, weeks later, they would ask for additional documentation. This happened 5 or more times. Later in the process, they asked for repeats of earlier documentation because the earlier documentation that had I provided was now ""too old."" I cannot tell if this patterns recured because the Bank doesn't care about customers, or because it is just incompetent. Every time we complained about additional requests or some promise that wasn't kept, Donna told us that our complaints were justified and she was sorry. But she was unable or unwilling to rectify the broken promises. We finally closed 13 weeks or so after our initial application. I can only imagine how long the process would have taken if we had not responded to every request from the Bank on the day they made it, and if we hadn't pushed hard to get this deal done. This Bank treats customers with complete disrespect. As someone who has owned several properties in my life and has received more than 10 home mortgages from different banks, I can honestly say that this is the worst mortgage experience I've ever had. You owe it to yourself to work with another Bank that is more professional and more respectful of customers.

The day before closing they were still asking for paperwork. The day of closing (while my household goods were being unpacked) I was told a Power of Attorney could not be used. I had to fly to ID (where my wife was) take the docs to a notary and Fedex them back. I also had to get a bank check to send with the docs because they wouldn't accept a personal check.

But then when I sent an email to all the lenders saying ""OK, the contract is signed. I want to select a lender and lock my rate TOMORROW, so please send me your best current rate and fees etc. with these EXACT loan parameters. It took the rep from NASB over a week to respond. So I replied to him ""thanks but you are too late, I have selected someone else and already locked my rate."" Over the following few weeks I continued to receive emails from him saying ""when you are ready to proceed with your loan, let me know"". We CLOSED on January 8th, and on February 5th I got another such email. I guess he didn't really ever read my emails. I also told him on the phone that he had missed the boat, but that seemed to fall on deaf ears too.

We were initially pretty skeptical about refinancing our home.  We’ve had personal and family issues that devastated our credit to the point where we felt that it would be a waste of time since we’d never be approved.  However, a real need arose when Dad’s declining health demanded we make room in our home so we can keep him close to us and give him the care he needs.  We weren’t sure what to expect from Patrick G at Reliance, but we were soon reassured and thoroughly delighted when Pat informed us that we were eligible and that he’d walk us through the entire process personally!  There simply are no superlatives sufficient to thank you for your fantastic guidance in getting our home refinanced!  You took what we assumed would be a challenging home refinance and successfully navigated us through the process to a successful conclusion.  In every single step, you proved to be friendly, patient, polite, knowledgeable, professional and consistently available to us.   We can't remember the last company we dealt with that returned calls and emails in such a timely manner!  You even personally called on weekends when there were items that needed our attention!  What more can a person ask for in a mortgage broker?  I will happily and enthusiastically recommend you to others.  Thanks Patrick for all your support and assistance... Read More

Ritu was a pleasure to work with. She was positive, energetic and knowledgeable. She was willing to help run through several different options to make sure we were happy with our plan. She helped us see the process through from beginning to end. I would work with her again.

Reliance was a pleasure to work with on my refinancing. With all the documents provided, we went from the start to closing in just a few weeks (with me on vacation for 1 week in the middle). I would do business with them again. A special mention to Ritu, who was a delight and helped keep our processing moving quickly.

New Federal regulations made this a tedious and time consuming process. Closing costs seemed a bit high. Seemed like I spent a lot of time explaining the obvious.

From the very first conversation that I had with Steve, I knew that he understood our situation perfectly and he was able to help us achieve our dream of home ownership. We were given very realistic expectations from the beginning and Steve kept in touch with us throughout the process. It was a relief to work with someone who gave us accurate information and didn't string us along.... Read More
